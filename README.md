# Ruby Chess
- A game which follows Ruby object-oriented best practices which allows two human players to play each other in Chess.

## Summary
  - At each step the player can use the keyboard to select a piece to move, and then uses a cursor to walk toward the place where heâ€™d like to move the piece.

  - When the cursor hovers over a particular piece, all the available moves for that piece are highlighted in blue.

  - If a move is invalid, the board will not let you move the piece.  This includes but is not limited to: trying to move a piece off the board.  Trying to move into check.  Not moving out of check.  Trying to move a piece over another one.

  - When a person is in check, a notification will display on the console, same things happens when a person is in checkmate
